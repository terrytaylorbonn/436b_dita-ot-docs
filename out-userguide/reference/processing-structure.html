  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">DITA-OT implements a multi-stage, map-driven architecture to process DITA content. Each stage in the
    process examines some or all of the content; some stages result in temporary files that are used by later steps,
    while others stages result in updated copies of the DITA content. Most of the processing takes place in a temporary
    working directory; the source files themselves are never modified.</p>
    <p class="p">DITA-OT is designed as a pipeline. Most of the pipeline is common to all output formats; it is known as the
        <dfn class="term">pre-processing stage</dfn>. In general, any DITA process begins with this common set of pre-processing
      routines.</p>
    <p class="p">Once the pre-processing is completed, the pipeline diverges based on the requested output format. Some processing
      is still common to multiple output formats; for example, Eclipse Help and HTML Help both use the same routines to
      generate XHTML topics, after which the two pipelines branch to create different sets of navigation files.</p>
    <p class="p">The following image illustrates how the pipeline works for several common output formats: PDF, Eclipse Help, HTML
      Help, XHTML, and HTML5.</p>
