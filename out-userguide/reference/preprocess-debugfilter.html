    <section class="section">
      <p class="p">The following modifications are made to the DITA source:</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">If a DITAVAL file is specified, the DITA source is filtered according to the entries in the DITAVAL
          file.</li>
        <li class="li">Debug information is inserted into each element using the <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@xtrf</code> and <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@xtrc</code>
          attributes. The values of these attributes enable messages later in the build to reliably indicate the
          original source of the error. For example, a message might trace back to the fifth <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;ph&gt;</code>
          element in a specific DITA topic. Without these attributes, that count might no longer be available due to
          filtering and other processing.</li>
        <li class="li">The table column names are adjusted to use a common naming scheme. This is done only to simplify later
          conref processing. For example, if a table row is pulled into another table, this ensures that a reference to
          "column 5 properties" will continue to work in the fifth column of the new table.</li>
