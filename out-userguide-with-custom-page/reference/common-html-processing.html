  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">After the pre-processing operation runs, HTML-based builds each run a common series of Ant targets to
    generate HTML file. Navigation may be created before or after this set of common routines.</p>
    <p class="p">After the pre-processing is completed, the following targets are run for all of the HTML-based builds:</p>
    <div class="p">
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">If the <span class="keyword parmname">args.css</span> parameter is passed to the build to add a CSS file, the
            <code class="ph codeph">copy-css</code> target copies the CSS file from its source location to the relative location in
          the output directory.</li>
        <li class="li">If a DITAVAL file is used, the <code class="ph codeph">copy-revflag</code> target copies the default start- and
          end-revision flags into the output directory.</li>
        <li class="li">The DITA topics are converted to HTML files. Unless the <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@chunk</code> attribute was specified, each
          DITA topic in the temporary directory now corresponds to one HTML file. The
            <code class="ph codeph">dita.inner.topics.xhtml</code> target is used to process documents that are in the map directory
          (or subdirectories of the map directory). The <code class="ph codeph">dita.outer.topics.xhtml</code> target is used to
          process documents that are outside of the scope of the map, and thus might end up outside of the designated
          output directory. Various DITA-OT parameters control how documents processed by the
            <code class="ph codeph">dita.outer.topics.xhtml</code> target are handled.</li>
      </ul>
