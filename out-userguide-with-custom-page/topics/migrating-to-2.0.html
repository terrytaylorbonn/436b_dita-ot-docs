      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">All transformations — variable typing</h2>
        
        <p class="p">XSLT stylesheets were converted to XSLT 2.0. With that change, variable types were also implemented. Plug-ins
          that change template variable values will need to make the following changes:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">Declare the same types defined in the default templates with <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@as</code>.</li>
          <li class="li">Ensure that the generated values conform to the declared type.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <div class="example">
        <p class="p">For example:</p>
        <pre class="pre codeblock language-xml"><code>&lt;xsl:variable name="urltest"&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name="urltest" <strong class="ph b">as="xs:boolean"</strong>&gt;</code></pre>
      </div>
      <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">All transformations — refactoring</h2>
        
        <p class="p">Much of the toolkit code was refactored for release 2.0. Customization changes that were based on a specific
          template in a previous version of the toolkit might not work because the modified template is no longer used.
          If this is the case, the changes will need to be reimplemented based on the new XSLT templates.</p>
      </section>
    </div>
    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">HTML5</h2>
      
      <p class="p">A new <span class="keyword option">HTML5</span> transformation type has been added. Customizations that previously modified the
        XHTML output to generate valid HTML5 should still work, but basing your customization on the new transformation
        type might simplify the customization and reduce the work required to maintain compatibility with future
        versions of the toolkit.</p>
      <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> <div class="note__body">The <span class="keyword option">HTML5</span> transformation was refactored with release 2.2. Before basing your customization
        on the changes in release 2.0, consider whether you might want to move to release 2.2 instead. See
        <a class="xref" href="migrating-to-2.2.html" title="In DITA-OT 2.2, the HTML5 transformation was refactored as its own plug-in and separate plug-ins were created for each of the rendering engine-specific PDF transformations.">Migrating to release 2.2</a>.</div></div>

    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Plug-in installation and distribution</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Plug-ins can now be installed or uninstalled from a ZIP archive using the new <span class="keyword cmdname">dita</span> command.
        Plug-ins can also be installed from a referenced URL. See
        <a class="xref" href="../parameters/dita-command-arguments.html" title="The dita command takes mandatory arguments to process DITA content. Subcommands can be used to manage plug-ins, or print information about the current configuration. A series of options are available to modify the command behavior or specify additional configuration parameters.">Arguments and options for the dita command</a>.</p>
